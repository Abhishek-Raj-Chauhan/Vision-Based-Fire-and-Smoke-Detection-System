# Vision-Based Fire and Smoke Detection System
 The aim of this project is real-time and accurate identification of fire and smoke occurrences to enhance disaster management and emergency response strategies.Utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with InceptionV3 and AlexNet architectures, along with data preprocessing, data augmentation, multiclass classification with softmax, ReLU activation, evaluation metrics such as accuracy, and frameworks like Keras and TensorFlow for efficient model development and deployment.
